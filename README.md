# CTF Bot (XSS)

This was a project I created to give to students as a CTF type exercise. The goal is for the student to retrieve the admin token using XSS and then use it to get the flag. At one point it was graded and so there are some minor anti-cheating mechanisms such as having a unique flag for each student generated on demand in addition to IP address logging. 

Selenium was used to similuate clicking on the page with the XSS payload so I did not have to do this every 2 minutes. This is the bot like feature. 

Paths and names were changed prior to upload so it will likely not execute without modification.
